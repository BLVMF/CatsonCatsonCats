Hello Friend!
This is Cats on Cats on Cats; it's a project I made in the first half of 2022.

How to use the site; click the dropdown menu, then pick a breed and then click the Here Kitty Kitty button. Don't be alarmed if it meows, that what it is supposed to do.

I received the API key from Aden over at https://thecatapi.com.

How the site works in laymans terms:
By the time the site has loaded in your browser your computer has made a request to thecatapi server (where information is stored) for a list of cat breeds and categories.
It then attaches that list into the dropdown menu so you can make a choice. As well as holding the information relating to each breed/category in the background.
Once you choose a breed/category it sorts through all of the breeds it's holding in the background and then shows you the one you picked earlier. Similarly to when a magician that shows you your card in the Prestige part of a trick. 

I have also included a random button; clicking it will display a random cat. Basically the site goes through the whole list of cat images randomly stops at one and then displays it to you; the user. 

I made some changes to the site from my wireframe version, they are as follows;

- removed the welcome image of a cat 

- added a carousel of testimonials.

- centred all the text 

- displayed the image in the main body of the site as opposed to a secondary page

- added an audio elements of 3 meows


Hope you enjoy using this as much as I did making it!
